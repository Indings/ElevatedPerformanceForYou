         Our client was one our group members dad, who needed a leadership consulting website.
        We included ten separate pages in our website and had navigation links throughout, that linked back to to this pages. Our resource blog page is lacking the links to various resources because the client had not responded with the appropriate information for this page. This page will feature links to resources the client deems important.
         We completelty built our website with only CSS and HTML without any use of libraries or frame works. 
         We had responsiveness through our website as you scaled it down, it reacted to different screen sizes.
          We included mulitple pictures throughout our website to better showcase our clients work and also had videos to go along with them. 
          Our website had a consitent navabar thoughout all ten pages and also had a conistent font as well. We utilized alot of flexboxes in the build process of our project.
          The CSS and HTML files are complient with WS3's validations and files only contain lowercase alphabet.
           Overvall, we worked really close with our client and made sure we made the website based off what he wanted, so we made alot of changes throughout to fit his exact needs, he was very satisified with the outome. 
           I believe we met all the project expectations and our client's expectations for this project. </P> 
            
        <P style = "text-indent: 1cm;" >Lee, our client has been apart of our build process of this website as I mentioned earlier. 
            He was very precise on how he wanted this website to be structured, he wanted us to include a lot of pictures showcasing his work to keep people engaged throughout.
             He was very impressed and satisified on how we brought this to life and all the progress we have made. </P>
