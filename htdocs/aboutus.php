            Elevated Performance 4 U was created in response to multiple requests for us to facilitate leadership development and increase board functionality. Our background in organizational, intrapersonal, interpersonal, and systemic communication coupled with 25 years of leadership experience has prepared our team to deliver tangible results for teams at all stages of success.   In the beginning, we received requests to work with good boards and teams who desired to be excellent.  These humble leaders knew they could be better than “good enough.”  We agreed to facilitate the workshops under the flowing conditions: 
            <ul>
                <li>Pre-assessment and specific research to prepare a meaningful, personal experience for all attendees</li>
                <li>Three-part workshop: 1. Self-awareness 2. Teaching Roles & Responsibilities 3. Practicing Excellence</li>
                <li>Follow-up and ongoing development reviewing and updating team commitments</li>
            </ul>
            Recently, we have been asked to facilitate recovery and response to the impact of the pandemic.  Leadership and teams are exhausted.  We have prepared an engaging & heart-infusing series of workshops deigned to propel our leadership teams into the future.
            <br> We are the ONLY group delivering this level of team comprehensive growth in the United States.  You can read the results and testimonies on this website.  We are asked back and have done multiple events in 98% of the districts and companies which speaks the value our clients experience during our workshops and seminars.  We often get asked “why are your prices so low?” Coming from an educational background, we are sensitive to school budgets and are passionate about leadership success.
